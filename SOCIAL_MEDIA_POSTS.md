## Reddit Post (r/reactjs, r/webdev, r/learnprogramming)

**Title:** Built an interactive English learning platform with React + Firebase [Open Source]

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I just finished building **StoryFlow**, an interactive English learning web app, and wanted to share it with the community.

**What it does:**
StoryFlow helps users learn English through video-based stories. Each story has three learning modes: listening comprehension, speaking practice (using Web Speech API), and writing exercises.

**Tech Stack:**
- React 18 (Hooks, Context API)
- Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Hosting)
- Tailwind CSS
- Web Speech API for pronunciation evaluation
- Local Storage + Firebase hybrid data strategy

**Key Features I'm proud of:**
1. **Gamification system** - XP/leveling with formula: `level = floor(sqrt(xp/100)) + 1`
2. **Hybrid storage** - Local storage for guests, Firebase for authenticated users
3. **Speech recognition** - Real-time pronunciation feedback
4. **Progress tracking** - Stats for listening, speaking, writing accuracy
5. **Skip functionality** - Users can skip questions without penalty
6. **Auth flexibility** - Guest mode OR sign in to sync across devices

**Challenges I solved:**
- Auto-syncing local data when users log in
- String similarity algorithms for writing/speaking evaluation
- Clearing local state properly on logout
- Fallback from Firebase to local JSON for reliability

**Live Demo:** [Your Firebase URL]
**GitHub:** [Your GitHub Repo]

Would love feedback on the code architecture, UX, or features you'd like to see added!
