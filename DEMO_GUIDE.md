## 🎮 Understanding the XP & Leveling System

### How XP Works

**Earning XP:**
- ✅ Correct listening answer: **+100 XP**

**Note:** Your XP can never go below 0!

### Leveling Formula

The app uses this formula to calculate your level:
```
Level = floor(sqrt(XP ÷ 100)) + 1
```

**Examples:**
- 0 XP = Level 1
- 100 XP = Level 2
- 400 XP = Level 3
- 900 XP = Level 4
- 10,000 XP = Level 11
